atelerix-0.3.0, 2015-07-23:

  * first version that inverts the inclusion order; instead of having
    a Makefile (atelerix) import the user's Makefile.build, allow the
    user to 'include atelerix'
  * accept patch from Philip Ramsey (rootcanal) for variables SYSTEMD
    and SYSCONFIG
  * many documentation fixes
  * fix issue with Makefile messing with parent directory of working
    directory, addressing long-standing request from Jon Nelson
  * improve the git support; set the default GIT_ID to HEAD, to behave
    as many would expect; add target 'git-tag'
  * improve README and update sample-build.txt file

2015-07-16: agglomerated patches all incorporated along with improved
  documentation and the following major features:
    * almost complete elimination of recursive calls to make
    * generate substitute.py from within makefile
    * prepare to make atelerix driver useable via a Makefile 'include'
    * nagios subpackage support
    * provide some support for including Python packages
    * remote tagging and branching supported for subversion
    * support pushing completed, built packages to OBS (Open Build Service)
    * improve the 'help' documentation tremendously
    * remove support for depotlite packages

(many years of use and small incremental improvements by many internal Renesys
contributors; code was never sent upstream)

2009-02-14: initial public release of atelerix, used and supported internally
  at Renesys corporation
