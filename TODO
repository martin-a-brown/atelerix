TODO
----
  * improve the smoothness of atelerix when used with git
  * make it so the Makefile can live permanently in a place like 
    /usr/lib/atelerix/Makefile.atelerix (credit for idea: gward)
  * create testing tools to make sure there's no retrogression
  * build a set of demonstrative and illustrative sample packages
